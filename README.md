# Movie Recommender
dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/rounakbanik/movie-recommender-systems/input

## Overview
This repository contains a Flask-based web application that provides movie recommendations using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. The application allows users to select a movie from a dropdown menu and receive a list of similar movies based on content-based filtering. It also includes a Jupyter notebook for evaluating intra-list similarity (ILS) of recommendations.

## Features
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Select2 for movie selection.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend movies based on their content.
- **API Endpoint**: Provides a JSON API to fetch movie titles for the dropdown search.
- **ILS Evaluation**: A Jupyter notebook to evaluate the intra-list similarity of recommendations for sampled movies.

## Requirements
To run the application, you need the following Python libraries:
- Flask==2.0.1
- pandas==1.3.5
- scikit-learn==1.0.2
- joblib==1.1.0
- numpy==1.21.6
- matplotlib==3.5.1 (for ILS evaluation in the notebook)

Frontend dependencies (loaded via CDN):
- Tailwind CSS
- jQuery==3.6.0
- Select2==4.1.0-rc.0

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RIcksenX/tfidf_cosinesim_moview_recommendation_program.git
   cd tfidf_cosinesim_moview_recommendation_program
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install flask pandas scikit-learn joblib numpy matplotlib
   ```
4. Ensure the precomputed data files (`movies_df.pkl` and `tfidf_matrix.pkl`) are in the project root directory.

## Usage
1. **Run the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will start in debug mode and be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
   - Use the dropdown to search for a movie by typing its title.
   - Select a movie and click "Get Recommendations" to view a table of recommended movies with similarity scores.

3. **Evaluate Intra-List Similarity**:
   - Open the `intra_list_similarity.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
   - Ensure `movies_df.pkl` and `tfidf_matrix.pkl` are in the same directory.
   - Run the notebook to compute ILS scores for a sample of 1000 movies and visualize the results.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Flask application with routes for the web interface and API.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for the web interface with Tailwind CSS and Select2.
- `intra_list_similarity.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for evaluating intra-list similarity of recommendations.
- `movies_df.pkl`: Precomputed DataFrame containing movie data.
- `tfidf_matrix.pkl`: Precomputed TF-IDF matrix for movie content.

## How It Works
- **Web Interface**: The frontend uses Select2 to fetch movie titles dynamically via the `/api/movies` endpoint. Users select a movie, and the form submits the `movie_id` to the server, which returns recommendations.
- **Recommendation Logic**: The `get_content_recommendations` function computes cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vector of the selected movie and all other movies, returning the top 10 most similar movies.
- **ILS Evaluation**: The notebook samples 1000 movies, computes ILS scores for their recommendations, and visualizes the results with a bar plot.

## Notes
- Ensure `movies_df.pkl` and `tfidf_matrix.pkl` are present, as they contain the preprocessed movie data and TF-IDF matrix.
- The application assumes movie IDs in `movies_df.pkl` are integers.
- For large datasets, the API response time may vary depending on the server and query complexity.
